# A-B-Test---DataAnalytic

A/B testing is a powerful statistical method used to compare two or more versions of a webpage or app to determine which performs better. It's a cornerstone of data-driven marketing, allowing marketers to make informed decisions based on empirical evidence rather than relying on intuition or assumptions.

**Business Problem** : the marketing team current website (old_page) have current conversion rate is `13%`, they want to see if their new design webpage (new_page) can increase the conversion rate to `15%`. so they want to hire a marketing data scientist, to perform a test and analysis to see if the new_page product a significant evidence supports the increasing in conversion rate.

**Result**:  While the provided results indicate a statistically significant difference (p-value of 0.044), the negative z-statistic suggests that the new webpage actually has a lower conversion rate than the old one.
