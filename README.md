# A-B-Test---DataAnalytic

A/B testing is a powerful statistical method used to compare two or more versions of a webpage or app to determine which performs better. It's a cornerstone of data-driven marketing, allowing marketers to make informed decisions based on empirical evidence rather than relying on intuition or assumptions.

**Business Problem** : the marketing team current website (old_page) have current conversion rate is `13%`, they want to see if their new design webpage (new_page) can increase the conversion rate to `15%`. so they want to hire a marketing data scientist, to perform a test and analysis to see if the new_page product a significant evidence supports the increasing in conversion rate.

**Result**: The Result of the Analysis shows that the new_page show a significant result different than the old_page (p-value is 0.044, so we can reject the Null Hypothesis), However, the z-statistic score is negative value indicates that the new_page results lower conversion rate compare to the old_page.
